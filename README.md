A global investment firm, FutureTech Investments, wants to identify the fastest-growing tech sectors and assess how traditional companies are adapting to disruption. They need insights on market share trends, stock performance, venture capital funding, 
and mergers & acquisitions in sectors like AI, cloud computing, e-commerce, cybersecurity, and FinTech. Using Power BI,
